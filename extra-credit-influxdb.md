InfluxDB is a popular open-source database that uses the time-series data model. It is designed specifically for storing and querying time-series data. It is optimized for high write and query performance, making it suitable for use cases such as monitoring, analytics, and IoT applications. InfluxDB stores data in a unique format called a "line protocol" that allows for efficient compression and indexing of time-series data. It also provides a SQL-like query language called InfluxQL for querying and analyzing the data. 

Its time-series data model differs from the other database models that we've covered in a couple ways. The first difference has to do with its time-series focus; InfluxDB is specifically designed for storing and querying time-series data, making it optimized for this use case. It provides efficient compression, indexing, and querying of time-series data, allowing for high performance and scalability. The second difference has to do with its Schemaless design as InfluxDB allows data to be added to the database without defining a strict schema beforehand. This allows for more flexibility in data modeling and makes it easier to adapt to changing data requirements over time.
